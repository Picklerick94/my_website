      <p>My goal is to help people build better and more meaningful products. With a strong background in UX & UI design, I make use of iterative hands-on processes and follow a human-centric design approach. My work ranges from strategic planning and rough prototyping in the early stages, to creating a strong visual design language, all of which increases the value of both the brand and the product.</p>
